            <p><b>Command & Conquer: Red Alert</b> is a real-time strategy computer game of the Command & Conquer
                franchise, produced by <b>Westwood Studios</b> and released by Virgin Interactive in 1996.
                The second major game to bear the C&C title, Red Alert was originally meant to be the prequel to
                the original Command & Conquer of 1995, and takes place in the early history of the
                alternate universe of Command & Conquer when Allied Forces battle an aggressive Soviet Union
                for control over the European mainland. It was initially available for PC (MS-DOS & Windows 95
                versions included in one package), and was subsequently ported to PlayStation. The PlayStation
                version was also re-released as a download on the PlayStation Network for PSP and PS3.</p>
